In 2022, trade between the two regions increased to $6.2 billion up from $5.4 Billion in 2021 last year. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing economic development of Africa, the growing middle class in Vietnam, and the easing of trade barriers between the two regions.The old legacy banking methods for money transfer are slow, expensive, and insecure. They can take days or even weeks for the money to arrive, and they often charge high fees. With the power of the Lightning Network we are able to solve these problems. It allows for fast, cheap, and secure payments to be sent and received near-instantly like a instant message or email today.Our partnership with Bitnob will allow us to offer African businesses the benefits of the Lightning Network for sending money to Vietnam.

The bitcoin and Lightning communities are bringing sound money to the world by building sound protocols. The value this focus provides becomes apparent in the depths of bear markets, when those who have been cutting corners are exposed. If the last couple months of chaos in the broader crypto industry have been disappointing, give sound money and sound protocols a try: we’re hiring.",

      "How Emerging Markets Are Powering Lightning Growth",
      "Lightning adoption continues to grow the fastest in emerging markets, and specifically the regions of Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. Answering the question “why” is actually a fairly straightforward two part endeavor.",
      "",
      "First, Chief Strategy Officer of the Human Rights Foundation Alex Gladstein tweeted the above chart which shows the percentage of Internet users aged 16 to 64 who own some form of cryptocurrency, according to GWI.com. Countries we explicitly highlighted above like Argentina, the Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, Brazil, and Nigeria all have ownership percentages of 20% or greater. That’s a full 5% higher than the US, 8% greater than the worldwide average, and 10-12% greater than Western European countries like Germany and France. This means there are potentially millions more bitcoin owners in emerging markets than in the developed countries that most “crypto” news is focused on.",
      "",
      "Why is this the case? As Gladstein opined above, the people in these markets do not need to be convinced of the ills of fiat currency, they have generations of lived experience with currency failures, hyperinflation, bank bail-ins, and all of the catastrophic downsides of fiat that the developed world has been lucky to avoid for the last several decades. Bitcoin Core Developer Gloria Zhao described this well after visiting Buenos Aires for Labitconf in November.",
      "",
      "So the first part of the answer to “why is Lightning growing fastest in emerging markets” is that people in those regions are adopting bitcoin at the fastest rates because they intuitively understand the value proposition of a money separated from state control. The second part of the answer comes from CEO Elizabeth Stark: “necessity is the mother of adoption.”",
      "",
      "Nearly all of our conversations with Lightning users in emerging markets center around the fact that using fiat payment rails in these areas is a nightmarish experience. High fees (especially when transferring internationally), consistent outages, censored payments, and more are the norm in these regions instead of the exception like they are in the developed world. Lightning today provides fees on the order of 1-20 bps (10-100x lower than fiat rails), with constant uptime, uncensorable payments, and provides the exact same experience whether users are buying groceries locally, or tipping a creator internationally. For a wide swath of emerging markets payments use cases, Lightning is already better than legacy payment rails, and international users are adopting it out of necessity.",
      "",
      "One unique way that Lightning allows businesses to tap into this demand is by enabling the permissionless earning of bitcoin. Stakwork is a globally accessible, Lightning-powered Mechanical Turk, breaking down business processes like preparing images for machine learning algorithms into microtasks, and paying an always-on network of crowdsourced workers via Lightning for completing each of those microtasks. These workers are joining Stakwork out of necessity, in order to earn money in their spare time, and end up adopting the Lightning Network for payments without even initially realizing it.",
      "",
      "Companies like ZEBEDEE and Thndr Games in the Lightning gaming community experience a similar phenomenon, as an outsized portion of users are based in emerging markets, play the games to earn money (and because they’re fun, of course!), and then adopt the Lightning Network to actually use their earnings to pay bills, buy groceries, etc.",
      "",
      "So in conclusion, why do we see such strong Lightning adoption in emerging markets? Because 1) the users want a currency alternative to their local fiat, as they have significant experience with all the downsides of fiat currency that the developed world has largely been spared of and 2) because necessity is the mother of adoption, and these users need the unique earning and spending experience that Lightning has to offer.",

      "After the initial launch of the alpha daemon for the Taro protocol, the community dove right in to play with the code and give invaluable feedback. Based on that feedback and some known issues, we released a new version of Taro (v0.1.1). This minor release includes a series of bug fixes and the ability to send \"full value assets\", enabling the sending of entire amounts of an asset without a change address/split. Keep an eye out for the next major 0.2 milestone, and a mainnet release soon. 👀",
      "",
      "In the world of Lightning Terminal, the latest release included updates to the Pool experience to simplify the ability to submit bids into the market and redeem sidecar channels. With the new Pool order wizard, node operators who want to increase their inbound can more easily submit bids.",
      "",
      "On the LND front, version 0.15.5 is the latest release with important bug fixes, and 0.16 will be coming soon with Taproot channels among other features. We very strongly urge everyone to upgrade to 0.15.5 (recommended) or 0.15.4 as they contain critical security fixes. Prior versions are not safe as they were affected by two bugs that would cause node operators to desync from the bitcoin blockchain.",
